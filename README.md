Crossminds is a playful yet intellectually stimulating crossword
website designed by a group of young creators aiming to make
learning fun and nostalgic for Gen Z. The platform blends education
and entertainment by embedding subject-focused clues into classic
crossword grids, encouraging users to think critically while engaging
with the content. Unlike conventional learning tools, Crossminds
focuses on mental stimulation through game-based learning, making
it an enjoyable way to build vocabulary, improve reasoning, and
revisit childhood joy.

Our crossword puzzles revolve around three core themes. 

1. Data Structures set tests technical understanding, encouraging
users to connect terms like "stack," "queue," or "binary tree" with their
functions and uses. 

2. Logical Reasoning puzzles focus on pattern recognition,
deduction, and problem-solving, often mimicking aptitude-style
questions in a fun and simplified form.

3. Emotional Ability crosswords offer a more reflective twist,
touching on empathy, emotional cues, and everyday human
interactions, promoting self-awareness alongside intellectual growth.


The front end of the website was crafted using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and JSON for dynamic clue handling and responsive
interaction. Madiha Javeed and Ahsanath Taqdees brought the visual
experience to life, ensuring it's vibrant and user-friendly. The
backend is powered by FastAPI, with Khushi Ozha and Sajani
Manimala handling server logic, clue management, and API
integration to seamlessly deliver the crossword experience to users.
